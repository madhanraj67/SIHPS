## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Environment

## Idea
The website will serve as a platform connecting individuals and businesses looking to recycle their electronic waste with certified recycling centers. It will provide information on the importance of e-waste recycling, guidelines on how to properly dispose of electronic devices, and facilitate the process of finding nearby recycling centers. Additionally, the website can incorporate features for tracking the environmental impact of recycling efforts, educational resources on sustainable electronics consumption, and a community forum for discussions on e-waste management practices

## Technology Stack
## Mobile App Development:
Platform: Cross-platform development using frameworks like React Native or Flutter can be beneficial as it allows you to build the app for both iOS and Android platforms simultaneously. Programming Languages: JavaScript (for React Native) or Dart (for Flutter). IDE: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or any preferred IDE for React Native or Flutter development.

## Backend Development:
Server-Side Language: Node.js with Express.js framework can be a good choice for building the backend APIs and server logic. Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing user data, device details, recycling center information, etc. API Documentation: Swagger/OpenAPI for documenting and defining your backend APIs.

## Authentication and User Management:
Authentication: Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication and authorization. User Data Storage: Use a secure and scalable storage solution for user data, such as Firebase Authentication and Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore.This technology stack provides a robust foundation for developing a feature-rich and scalable mobile application like "EcoRecycle" that promotes responsible e-waste disposal and engages users in environmental conservation efforts.

## Dependencies
React Native: A JavaScript framework for cross-platform mobile app development. Express.js: A minimalist Node.js web framework for building backend APIs. Firebase: For authentication, real-time database, and push notifications. Google Maps API: For integrating maps and geolocation services in the app. Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend server. Redux (for React Native) or Provider (for Flutter): For state management and data flow control. Mongoose (for MongoDB) or PostgreSQL Client (for PostgreSQL): For database operations and data modeling.
